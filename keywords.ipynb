    "#1) Explain the significance of Python keywords and provide examples of five keywords.\n",
    "\"\"\"Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot\n",
    " be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) because they are part \n",
    " of the language syntax. These keywords are crucial for defining the structure and logic \n",
    " of Python programs.we can use <help('keywords')> to see all the keywors in python.\n",
    " example of 5 keywors are:\n",
    " 1) int \n",
    "  The int keyword is used to convert a value to an integer.\n",
    "        a=\"42\"\n",
    "        b=int(a)\n",
    " 2)print\n",
    "   The print keyword is used to display output in the console.\n",
    "        print(\"hello world\")\n",
    " 3)input:\n",
    "   The input keyword is used to take user input. It returns the input as a string.\n",
    "       a=input(\"enter your name\")\n",
    " 4)if, else:\n",
    "        The if statement checks a condition. If it's true, it executes a block of code. \n",
    "        Otherwise, the else block is executed.   \n",
    "            x = 5\n",
    "            if x > 0:\n",

    "                print(\"Non-positive number\")\n",
    " 5)len:\n",
    "     The len keyword is used to get the length of a sequence, such as a string, list, or tuple.\n",
    "     python\n",
    "            message = \"Hello, World!\"\n",

    "\"\"\"Rules for Identifiers in Python:\n",
    "     1)Valid characters include letters (upper and lower), digits, and underscore.\n",
    "     2)Case-sensitive: myVar and myvar are different.\n",
    "     3)Avoid using Python keywords or reserved words.\n",
    "     4)Start with a letter or underscore, not a digit.\n",
    "      Example:\n",
    "           variable_name = 42\n",
    "           _myVar = \"Hello\"       are valid identifiers.\"\"\"\n",

    "\"\"\"Comments in Python are text annotations within the code that are not\n",

    "    for temporarily disabling a piece of code.  Improve code readability and \n",
    "    maintainability.\n",
    "    1) you can create single-line comments using the #\n",

    "  Enforces Structure: Indentation defines block structures in Python.\n",
    "  Readability: Proper indentation makes code visually clear and easy to understand.\n",
    "  Execution: Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or unintended logic.\n",
    "  Pythonic Style: Follows PEP 8, Python's style guide, enhancing code consistency.\n",
